Stack Implementation in Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of a stack data structure in Python.

## Overview

A **stack** is a data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) principle. This implementation provides basic stack operations such as `push` (to add an element) and `pop` (to remove an element).

The stack will throw a **Stack Overflow** error if you try to push an element when the stack is full, and a **Stack Underflow** error if you try to pop an element when the stack is empty.

## Features

- **Push Operation**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop Operation**: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
- **Overflow Handling**: Prevents pushing elements when the stack is full.
- **Underflow Handling**: Prevents popping elements from an empty stack.
